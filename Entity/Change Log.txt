////////////// Prey Changelog     /////////////////////////////
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

[06.Apr.11] - Replaced all 'Maps.map[mapnumber]..' code with a single 'Map' reference in each mapForm (don't know why it wasn't done this way before, the abstraction made no logical sense and was harder to code with..)
			- Moved map load code into a static 'Map.LoadFromFile(..', and made the Map .ctor internal.
			- changed MainMenuEdit.cs to use Map objects not MapForms, and moved required code from MapForm into static methods.
			- Removed 'Maps' class, placed Refresh method in 'Map'.
			- Windows form generated code, in mapform and mainform, grouped together and placed at bottom of each code file out of the way.
			- Lot of map load code commented
			- Main form methods grouped together by relevance and placed in regions. Updated some menu names to reflect their usage.
			- MetaEditor control now checks Meta Editor .xml exists before loading it to stop the mapForm designer crashing saying the file doesn't exist.
			- Almost complete with grouping methods in MapForm into regions.

[07.Apr.11] - Finished placing all mapForm methods in regions.
			- Moved classes in Map.cs to their own files.
            - Restructured file hierarchy in solution explorer.
            - Removed unused files.
			- Ran solution through NArrange tool, which has arranged every code file so they all follow the same code standard
			- Ran solution through DeCodEx tool which moves generated windows form UI code from the main file to a partial class in a designer file.
			- Moved HaloMap and MetaEditor Projects into same folder as Main Project.
			- Moved solution file outside entity project folder.
			- Replaced all Application.StartupPath uses with Global.StartupPath; A custom variable that always points to the release folder, meaning dont have to have a copy of plugins etc in the debug folder.
			- created a Global.ShowErrorMsg function for use when a messagebox is shown in a catch statement. This function also shows the internal error for better debugging.

[08.Apr.11] - Ran Resharper Code Cleanup, with StyleCop plugin, on Solution.
			- Removed ref to map object in all meta class functions, and replaced with a single ref in the ctor, with refactoring
			- Placed one meta scanner object in meta object, and refactored methods to use that.
			- Replaced 'tagnumber' with 'TagIndex'
			- Moved Metafunctions into Miscfunctions file, and removed map params from all these methods too.
			- Made chunkAdder non-static and an object of Map, and moved into HaloMap lib.
			- Removed most of places where map is passed as a parameter needlessly.
	
[09.Apr.11] - Moved a lots of files into HaloMap
			- Started creating xml prefs file for storing all settings, instead of the registry..

[10.Apr.11] - Finished xml prefs stuff.

[11.Apr.10] - Removed passing around of intptr for bitmaps.
			- Refactored namespaces
			- Fixed most warnings
			- Ran Ghostdoc on solution
